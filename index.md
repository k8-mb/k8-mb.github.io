_fourreal GmbH_ is a real estate company based in Vienna and operating in
Vienna and Berlin.

In 2016 I and my wife bought an apartment in Berlin from _fourreal K8
GmbH & Co KG_, one of the affiliates of the _fourreal group_.  We are
currently in a court proceeding against them.  We are not the only
ones that needed the help of lawyers and courts while dealing with
fourreal.

A court can only help us in recognize the border between legal and
illegal.  And I am sure, the real estate market in Berlin is providing
lot of work to the local courts.  I am writing these chronicles to
explore borders more blurred: the ones between professional and
amateurish, polite and cocky, cunning and sneaky, reasonable and
greedy.

For a quick glance, please see the [synopsis](synopsis).

For reference, there is a [time-line](timeline), with annotations of
dates and facts.
