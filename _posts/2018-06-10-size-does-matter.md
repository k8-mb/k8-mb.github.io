title: "Size Does Matters"
---

Before signing the contract, the real estate agent, Mr. Jendrzejewski of Bewocon GmbH, illustrated the property using a [floor plan][floor-plan-1] which has the size of every room specified.  The bedroom size is indicated as 12.26 m² and the
bathroom 8.77 m².  We visited the construction site on 10 February 2016 and on 31 March 2016.  At that time there were not internals wall.
The same floor plan have been provided by fourreal's when they sent us the draft of the contract.  When we signed the contract, however, we signed a
slightly different [floor-plan][floor-plan-2], that had two steps in the entrance.

As they built the internal walls, we got the impression that the bedroom and the bathroom were smaller.  We hired an architect to measure the rooms.
However, in order to be valid, a measurement must be done when the construction is ready, after the layering of the wooden floor.  So, we had to wail a long time, because of the complications created by fourreal and the
consequent delayed in the delivery.  Such complications are another story that deserves its own chronicle. In the end, we are able to have the [measures][measures]: the bedroom is 11.15 m² instead of 12.26 m² and the bathroom 6.82 m² instead of 8.77 m².

Since the living room is slightly bigger of the original plan, the total size of the property is respecting the allowed maximal deviation of 2%, as specified in the purchase contact. fourreal refuse to recognized the defect, as,
in their opinion the contracts do not contains any guarantee over the
measures of the singles rooms.

How it is possible?   The trick is that the floor plan we signed does not have measures in it.  So, fourreal claims that the purchase contract contains no obligation about the measures of single rooms.
Note that the floor plan with the measure is still part of the official documents, but, apparently, it is not part of the purchase contract, probably because it is not signed.

It is worth noting that the door in the bathroom [did not even open][washing-bowl] because of the small dimension of the room, they have been forced to relocate the washing-bowl, before the acceptance negotiation.  In this way, the door can open properly, but one of the power outlets is useless, and the asymmetry of the outlets and the pipes is not really nice. Also, according to an architect we hired, the bowl should be fixed in an armor inside the wall, it is not obvious that moving it will not affect its stability.

It is pretty clear to me that this is a huge error of construction.  It is not easy to accept that "the purchase contract contains no guarantees on the size of single rooms".  Of course no one would complain about small differences, but here we are talking about difference of 25%.  Also, before signing the contract, we asked [modifications][bathroom-customizations] to fourreal in the bathroom.  For instance we asked for a bigger shower area.  We did our requests on the basis of the informations provided by fourreal.

It could be argue about our naïveness in signing the "new" floor-plan.
Indeed, we were worried about the steps.  According to Mr. Jendrzejewski, who represented fourreal, they were just a little adjustment caused by building needs.  Of course, we were a bit uncomfortable with this last-minute
modification.  We should have refuse to sign, and start a negotiation for a reduction in price. However, refusing it would have imply another meeting by the
notary, that we would have been cost to us € 2000.  It would have required a lot more time.  We had a long tractative to agree with fourreal on a suitable date for signing the contract.  It was not obvious that fourreal would have agreed to a reduction in price, since prices for real estate properties were growing all the time.  In the end, we didn't worry at all about the measures, also because the original floor-plan was part of a folder that present the seal from the notary, so, we thought it was part of the contract anyway.

We discover later, that, since folder containing the original
floor-plan has not been signed, it is not part of the contract.
At least, that is the position of fourreal.
I doubt the questions is that simple.  Even if it is true (and not being a lawyer, I have to authority on the matter), it seems to me a clear case of misinformation.  Of course, part of it  could be attribuited to the real estate agency, Bewocon, that as soon as we sign the contract just disapperared, but this is matter for another story.  Fourreal itself sent us the plan in the draft of the contract, and in the set of documents of which the purchase contracts belongs, so there is no reason to doubt that Bewocon used measures provided by fourreal.
