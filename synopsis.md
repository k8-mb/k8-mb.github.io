Dealing with fourreal is a daunting process.

In the beginning they called me and my wife for a lot of meetings with
the construction company.  During these meetings, they provided
ambiguous, and sometime false, informations.  They involved us in
their tractative with their contractors.  Then, they pretended to have
nothing to do with that, and blamed us to have stepped over them in
dealing with the construction company.  By the way, the
professionality of their contractors, make me think they are the
cheapest on the market.

One of their employees, Mr. Klugsberger, is in an ambiguous situation:
he is alse the directing manager of _PeakReal GmbH_, that acts as real
estate agent for the project in Kärntener Straße.  He sends e-mails
both as a fourreal's representat, both as a PeakReal's one, even if we
never dealt with PearReal.  I am surprise it is allowed by the law.

They have sent us unsigned certifications and false documents,
regarding the legal status of our building.  They claimed that our
four-floor building is less that seven meters high, and so do not
require static-proofing.  We pointed out the "mistake" and they sent
us the same document again.

They added a modified floor plan to our purchase contract at the last
minute, when we met by the notary to sign it.  The new floor plan has
no measures for singles rooms, contrarily to the one used until this
point.  In implementation of the flat, the bathroom and bedroom are
much smaller than originally indicated.

We have chosen a parquet following their instructions.  As agreed, we
have paid the difference in the material. They told us the parquet
would have required a very complicated installation, with sanding and
oiling.  That is false.  Not only they asked for additional € 3000,
they would have ruined our, lacquered, parquet.  We had to hire a
lawyer and an architect to being able to have our parquet properly
installed. And we paid the added costs anyway, that amounts to € 700.

The added two steps in the floor-plan at the last minute. We expected
them to be in concrete, but they realized in wood.  We tried to
contract about the implementation, since there are no specification in
the purchase contract.  We even offer to contribute to the expenses,
if concrete would have been more expensive.  They told us that making
the step in concrete in nonsense, and every expert would have
confirmed their opinion.  When I asked for the opinion of _their_
expert, he did not says that it would have been impossible.  He says
that it was too late.  This certifications come after two months of
negotiation on the issue.  Other experts I consulted told me that the
certification itself is nonsense, and there is absolutely no problem
in making them in concrete.

The contract specify two distinct outlets for the cooking-plan and the
oven.  They realized only one.  When I asked, they did not know what
the contract specify.  Instead of making another outlet near the
existing one, as I asked, they wanted me to send them the kitchen
plan, and they misinterpreted the fridge for the oven, making the
outlet in the wrong place.

We asked for a larger shower area.  They realize it, but with
different, cheaper, specifications.  And it istalled on a step, of
which we have not been informed.  They have tried to attribute every
deviation from the contract by our request, but their argomentations
are dropping one by one.

There should have been a pocket door that has not been realized, so,
there is no separation between _day_ areas and _night_ areas.  Since
the pocket door is specified only in the floor plan, they seem to
pretend it is not due.  Experts tell us otherwise.  And every other
flat in the building actually _has_ an equivalent solution.

There should be a gate in garden that has never been realized.
fourreal refuse to realize it.  They first said that it is not due,
then that it is in the floor plan only to illustrate the orientation
of the garden, then that the construction authorities forbids its
realization.  Again, they are not able to show a single evidence of
these claims.

The whole terrace is on a step that has never been indicated, and the
sand between the bricks went away at the first rain.

A lot of other things has been poorly realized: some doors does not
close or does not open properly, the ring bell has not worked for one
year, we already have damages by moisture, and the list would be very
long.

On top of that, they are now forcing us to accept a resolution that
allows them to pay a monetary amount instead of finishing some works
in jointly owned properties.  Of course we agree with the principle,
given the quality of their works, but we have not subscribed the terms
of the agreement.  Apparently, they do not care that our signatures
are missing, they already deposited the money.  With regret, I have to
says, that they are doing that with the complicity of the
administration.

Each of the issues outlined here will be expanded in the future, in
this chronicles, but it will take a bit of time.
