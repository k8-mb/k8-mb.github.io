# Fourreal in Berlin

_Fourreal GmbH_ is a real estate company based in Vienna and operating in
Vienna and Berlin.

I and my wife bought a flat from them and we are in a court proceeding against them.  Our flat has been delivered late and with several defects.  The trial is planned for September.  Being forced to bring them in front of a court is only a small part of the unpleasing experience of dealing with fourreal.

Defects are annoying.  But they can be checked and quantified.  They can be fixed.  They can be compensated.  They are good material for lawyer and architects; I guess that is the reason why they are the main object of our trial.

The worst part is the unprofessional approach of fourreal.  Their false statements, their missed replies, their reluctance to put anything in written form, their double-wording.  Fourreal's people like to think at themselves as the cunning guys, that are able to purse their goals while being formally correct.  Unfortunately for them, more often that not, they are too amateurish for being really dangerous.
