# Fourreal in Berlin

_Fourreal GmbH_ is a real estate company based in Vienna and operating in
Vienna and Berlin.

I an my wife bought an apartment in Berlin from _fourreal K8 GmbH & Co KG_, one of the affiliates of the _fourreal group_.  We are currently in a court proceeding against them, and we are not the only ones that needed the help of lawyers and courts while dealing with fourreal.

A court can only tell us what is legal and what is not.
I am writing these chronicles to explore borders even more blurred that the one between legal and illegal: the ones between professional and amateurish, humble and arrogant, cunning and sneaky, reasonable and greedy.

Besides the chronicles, for those interested, there is a [time-line](timeline) that reports the facts as happened.  It is probably a bit boring to read, and will be frequently updated, being mostly used as references.  Images are available on [instagram](https://instagram.com/k8_mb).
