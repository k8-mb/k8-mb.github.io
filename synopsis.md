I cannot say that dealing with fourreal is a pleasant experience.

They added a new floor plan to the contract at the last minute, when
we met by the notary to sign it.

They have provided different contracts to us and to the construction
company, and when the discrepances emerged, they carried on a
negotiations with us, pretending they were not involved.  Later on,
they blamed us for that.

By the way, they hired the most unprofessional construction companies
that you can imagine, that was absolutely unable to write or document
anything, and used to works without any care for quality or their own
security.

They systematically refuse to communicate properly: most requests by
e-mail remain unanswered, most appointment ignored.

They are very cocky: always overconfident about their claims, to the
point of calling for nonsense at each objection.  Almost always, facts
proves them wrong, but their apprach do not change.

They sent us false documents, claiming that our four-floors building
is not higher that seven meters, and, as such, it does not need a
static proof.  When I raised the objections, their lawyer send me the
very same document again.

They deposited an amount of money instead of finishing the works of
the commonly owned property, regardless they do not have the
authorization of all the owners.  Again, it is almost impossible to
have a clarification.

Most people says that is pretty normal in the real estate market.
Maybe most operator of the market are cunning businessmen.  Maybe it
is a market that is full of scammers.  But I strongly doubt that the
mix of sneakiness and incompetence showed by fourreal is that common.
And it is sad that the current state of the market let them
survive. But maybe that will not be the case.
