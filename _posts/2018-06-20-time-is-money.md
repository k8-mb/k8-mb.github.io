After a couple of month of negotiation with fourreal, I decide to hire
a lawyer.  I would say I am forced: it is crystal clear that fourreal
is realizing that something is going wrong with their construction
company, and they want to dump the issues to us.  They have two
different specification in two contracts: one, more expensive
specifications with us, and a cheaper one with the constructor
company.  They make a lot of unfounded claims.  They claim we have
bought a _massiv-parket_, after the material has arrived.  They claim
that the two steps in the entrance would be covered by tiles, "because
they are a standard component", even if our contract specify that it
should be parquet.  They pretend to not have been involved in the
negotiation of the last months, and blame us to have stepped over them
by talking directly with the construction company.

I am starting to think that fourreal is only Mr. Klugsberger, a young
man that just want to have a shot in the real estate business.  I
cannot find any other explanation to this level of amateurish behavior.
As soon as I mention my intentions of hiring a lawyer to
Mr. Klugsberger, he immediately suggests against it, because then
fourreal will call their lawyers and a long battle will start, so we
will spend a lot of money and our flat will never be ready.

As it should be clear by now, I tend to not follow Mr. Klugsberger
suggestions, so I hired a lawyer to write a letter to him.  As I
suspected, the reply to this letter comes from Mr. Klugsberger, and
not from the announced army of lawyers.  However, I have reasons to be
surprised.  In the correspondence with our lawyer, Mr. Klugsberger
insists on his line.  He still says that we have a _massiv-parkett_,
that it require further treatments.  And he still blame the
construction company. Even the lawyer is surprised in seeing someone
who attacks so openly their associated.

In the meantime, the deadline for the delivery is passed, and the
apartment is far from being ready.  Of course, fourreal will blame us
for the delay, because, according to them, we are late in choosing the
samples.  A quick look to the [photographic documentation][delay] of
our flat, two weeks after the planned delivery date, is a good sample
of how surreal are fourreal's argumentations.

Still, we are talking about the parquet.  Mr. Klugsberger complains
that "we are going around in circles", and that the only solution is
that we sign a separate contract for the parquet.  Our lawyer suggests
that we can pay for now, and then still ask for verification of the
deal.

We accept an invitation for a meeting with Mr. Klugsberger and
Mrs. Orgovanyi-Hanstein, co-owner and executive manager of the fourreal
group.  I hope that we finally can met someone more professional.

The first thing that Mrs. Orgovanyi-Hanstein says is that our contract
specify _parkett-dielen_.  I am not impressed.  Luckily enough,
Mr. Klugsberger immediately shout her mouth.  In feeling relieve
after an action of Mr. Klugsberger, I realize that things are going
south.

Indeed they are.  They repeat the same story: "you have negotiated
with Mr. Unger a parquet different from the specifications". Which
specification? It should be Oak instead of Walnuts? Ok, we pay the
difference, we already said we will do.  Since the price of the
material is indicated in the contract, it shouldn't be a problem to
choose another one.

And I point out that I send them an e-mail time ago, and they replied
that "everything is fine with the wooden floor".  But now it seems
that a mail is not a contract, and they start asking: "Do you have a
contract with Mr. Unger?", "Have you already payed the material?",
and so on.

Mrs. Orgovanyi-Hanstein starts to complain that we are wasting her
time, and for her "time is money".  Again, I am not impressed.  What
about _my_ time.  Anyway, they invited us telling that we would have
signed a contract, but now, they ask us to _contribute_ for an amount
of â‚¬ 2000.  Ok, we accept, mostly because we need to relocate in our
new flat as soon as possible.  We agree that we would have send the an
e-mail with our intention to pay.

Then they start to talk about the steps.  Which they want to realize
in wood, and we want in concrete.  They have a lot of fun because I
used the word "cement" instead of "concrete", and with great
satisfaction they lecture me about the fact that cement is a powder,
and it is impossible to make two steps with a powder.  Of course
someone that propose something like that does not know what is talking
about.  And the poor Mrs. Orgovanyi-Hanstein is forced to waste her
precious time with foll like that.

They have their fun, they I ask: "Ok, we agree that we do not want to
make the steps in cement. What about concrete?" They continue laughing,
because of course, concrete is too heavy and the idea itself is
nonsense.

Since in a previous e-mail Mr. Klugsberger was talking about a
pre-built "podestum" in concrete, I inform him that I never thought of
a "podestum", but concrete casting.  They laugh again, apparently,
it does not make any difference.

They laugh even louder, when I ask them for an official certification
of the impossibility of my proposal.

However, in a few days they provide me the opinion of their expert.
And the opinion is order to do a "podestum", a new static proofing
would be needed.  And it is too late for concrete casting.

It does not sound like nonsense.  Considering we are talking about
that since months, I could deduce that they wasted time by purpose, in
order to be legitimized to realize the cheapest solution.

In any case, we [accepted][mail-20160927] to pay for the parquet, and we will have the
step in woods.  We lost on all front. Well, it is not _that_ bad, but this the subject of the next chronicle.
