Dealing with fourreal is a daunting process.

I have not seen anyone of fourreal until [six week before the delivery
deadline][meeting-fourreal]. And as soon as they appeared, it started
a serie of meetings with them and the construction company.

During these meetings, they provided us ambiguous, incomplete, and
sometime false, information.  They involved us in the negotiation with
their contractors.  Later on, they pretended to have nothing to do
with that, and blamed us to have stepped over them in dealing with the
construction company.  By the way, the [workmanship][men-at-work] of
their contractors is, to be polite,  uncertain.

One of fourreal's employees, Mr. Klugsberger, is in an ambiguous
situation: he is also the directing manager of _PeakReal GmbH_, that
acts as real estate agent for our building.  He sends e-mails both as
a fourreal's representative, and as a PeakReal's one, even if we
never dealt with PeakReal.  I am surprise it is allowed by the law.

They have sent us unsigned certifications and false documents,
regarding the legal status of our building.  They claimed that our
four-floor building is less that seven meters high, and so do not
require static-proofing.  We pointed out the "mistake" and they sent
us the same document again.

They added a [modified floor plan][floor-plan-2] to our purchase
contract at the last minute, when we met by the notary to sign it.
The new floor plan has no measures for singles rooms, contrarily to
[the one used until this point][floor-plan-1].  In implementation of
the flat, the bathroom and bedroom are [much
smaller][size-does-matters] than originally indicated.

We have chosen a parquet following their instructions.  As agreed, we
have paid the difference in the material. They told us the parquet
would have required a very complicated installation, with sanding and
oiling.  That is false.  Not only they asked for additional € 3500,
they would have ruined our, lacquered, parquet.  We had to hire a
lawyer and an architect to being able to have our parquet properly
installed. And we paid the added costs anyway, that amounts to € 700.

They added two steps in the floor-plan at the last minute. We expected
them to be in concrete, but they are realized in wood.  We tried to
[negotiate][time-is-money] about the implementation, since there are
no specification in the purchase contract.  We even offer to
contribute to the expenses.  They told us that making the step in
concrete in nonsense, and every expert would have confirmed their
opinion.

When I asked for the [opinion of _their_ expert][roloff-stairs], he
did not says that it would have been impossible.  He says that it was
too late. This certifications come after two months of negotiation on
the issue.  Other experts tell me that the certification itself is
nonsense, and there is absolutely no problem in making them in
concrete.

The contract specify two distinct outlets for the cooking-plan and the
oven.  They realized only one.  When I asked, they did not know what
the contract specify.  Instead of making another outlet near the
existing one, as I asked, they wanted me to send them the kitchen
plan, and they misinterpreted the fridge for the oven, making the
outlet in the wrong place.

We asked for a larger shower area.  They realized it, but with
different, cheaper, specifications.  And it is installed on a step, of
which we have not been informed.  They are trying to attribute every
deviation from the contract to our request, but their argumentation
are dropping one by one.

There should have been a pocket door that has not been realized.
Since the pocket door is specified only in the floor plan, they
pretend it is not due.  Experts tell us otherwise.  And every other
flat in the building actually has an equivalent solution.

There should be a gate in the garden that has never been realized.
fourreal, at first, said that it is not due, then that it is in the
floor plan only to illustrate the orientation of the garden, then that
the construction authorities forbid its realization.  Again, they are
not able to show a single evidence of these claims.

The whole terrace is on a step that has never been indicated, and the
sand between the bricks went away at the first rain.

A lot of other things has been poorly realized: some doors does not
close or does not open properly, the ring bell has not worked for one
year, we already have damages by moisture, and the list would be very
long.

On top of that, they are now forcing us to accept a resolution that
allows them to pay a monetary amount instead of finishing some works
in jointly owned properties.  Of course we agree with the principle,
given the quality of their works, but we have not subscribed the terms
of the agreement.  Apparently, they do not care that our signatures
are missing, they already deposited the money.  With regret, I have to
says, that they are doing that with the complicity of the
administration.

Each of the issues outlined here will be expanded in the future, in
this chronicles, but it will take a bit of time.
