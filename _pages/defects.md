## Bathroom

#### Parquet/Tiles junction

The junction between parquet and tiles in the bathroom was missing, we
provided to install it by ourselves.

#### Bathroom size

The bathroom is about 2 square meters smaller than prescribed in the
floor-plan.  Because of the different size we changed our plan of
having a dividing door for the recess in which the washing machin is
located.  Also we choose the shower stall on the basis of the wrong
measure.

#### Shower trail and drainpipe

The drainpipe of the shower is specified in the contract as
"Duschrinne CeraLine".  Here are some pictures found on internet:

![ceraline01](/assets/imgs/ceraline01.jpg)
![ceraline02](/assets/imgs/ceraline02.jpg)

These pictures show a drainpipe that is on level with the bathroom
floor.  The shower in our flat looks quite different:

![shower-floor01](/assets/imgs/shower_floor01.jpg)

In particular, it has a step that was not described.  So, apart from
the price of the drainpipe (the installed one looks way cheaper that
the prescibed one), there is a difference in accessibility to the
shower.


#### Shower stall

There is a metallic seal in shower, but it does not cover the whole height.

![shower01](/assets/imgs/shower01.jpg)
![shower02](/assets/imgs/shower02.jpg)
![shower03](/assets/imgs/shower03.jpg)


The connections with tiles are not well done, they have lot of silicon on one side and a likely extraneous piece of metal on the other side.

#### WC and BD too high

The WC and bidet are too high, they are uncorfortable for an average tall person.
According to the [common knowledge][wc-height] a wc should be about 37 cm height.  There are also "comfort WC", intended for old people, or people with disabilities that are about 42 cm.   WC and bidet in our flat are 48 cm height.
According to fourreal, there is no legal specification of the WC height, so this can not be considered a defect.

#### Hydraulic connection of BD

Hydraulic connection are visible in the bottom and some elements are
not properly fastened.

#### Valve in the shower

According to the contract, the pipes should be inside the wall.

## Bedroom

#### Bedroom door

The bottom of the door is defective:

![bedroom-door-bottom](/assets/imgs/bedroom_door_bottom.jpg)


The top of the door is defective:

![bedroom-door-top](/assets/imgs/bedroom_door_top.jpg)

These defects have been only partially fixed.

The bedroom door open by itself if not locked.
The key is missing.

#### Bedroom size

The bedroom is about 1 square meter smaller than prescribed in the
floor-plan.  Because of the differnt size we changed our plan about
the size and the location of the wardrobe and in general the forniture
of the room.  We also needed to buy a more expensive bed that can act
as chest.

## Corridor

#### Heating panel instructions

The heating panel was missing any instructions.  Some handwritten
labels have been added, but we are not sure they are enough.

#### Parquet damaged by flooding on 10.01.2017

The parquet near the bathroom has been damaged by flooding on 10.01.2017.
This is a picture taken at 21 o'clock:

During the night, water comes out again and reached the parquet:

![bathroom-flooding-5](/assets/imgs/bathroom-flooding_20170111_000820.jpg)
     
The following day, at 8 o'clock, it happened again:

![bathroom-flooding-6](/assets/imgs/bathroom-flooding_20170111_080009.jpg)
     
We immediately informed the workers, and it seems they have fixed it.

This floodings followed the one in the cellar of the day before, the 09.01.2017:  
  
![cellar-flooding-01](/assets/imgs/cellar-flooding-01.jpg)
![cellar-flooding-02](/assets/imgs/cellar-flooding-02.jpg)

and the works done by the construction company to fix it.

## Living room / Kitchen

#### Living room right door.

The right door in the living room does not open properly. The first
picture shows how a door should open, the second one show the
defective one:

![door-correct](/assets/imgs/door_correct.jpg)
![door-livingroom](/assets/imgs/door_livingroom.jpg)

There is also a scratch near the handle:

![living-room-door](/assets/imgs/living_room_door.jpg)

#### Main entrance door floor

The floor under the main door is not finished.

![main-door01](/assets/imgs/main_door01.jpg)

#### Wall painting damaged

The wall near the door is damaged:

![entrance-wall](/assets/imgs/entrance-wall.jpg)

The damage is likely caused by moisture in the wall.
That could be a really serious issue.

#### Locker of main door

The locker does not allow a complete locking.  Only one turn of the key is possible.

#### Fuse box instructions

Instruction for the fuse box in the electric panel are missing.

![fuse-panel](/assets/imgs/fuse_panel.jpg)

#### Connection main door floor and parquet.

There is a gap between the door and the parquet.

![main-door02](/assets/imgs/main_door02.jpg)

#### Ring bell

The ring bell is not working.

#### Oil in the entrance stairs.

The stairs in the entrance were missing the last treatment.
Update: after the abnahme, it has been done, but with a very disappointing quality.

## Small Room

#### Door

The door does not open properly. The first picture shows how a door
should open, the second one show the defective one:

![door-correct](/assets/imgs/door_correct.jpg)
![door-child-bedroom](/assets/imgs/door_child_bedroom.jpg)

## Terrace

#### Steps

There are steps not indicated in the contracts.
The steps are poorly realized

![garden-steps01](/assets/imgs/garden_steps01.jpg)
![garden-steps02](/assets/imgs/garden_steps02.jpg)
![garden-steps03](/assets/imgs/garden_steps03.jpg)

#### Valve in the garden

The valve in the garden has not yet been realized.  It is not included
in the contract, but we asked for it to the seller before signing.
They told us that it would have been done and we should have asked the
construction company.  Later on we agreed about it with both the
construction company and the seller.  The valve is _extremely_
important to us: one of the reason we choose this flat is the
opportunity it offers of having a small garden with some plants.
Without the availability of water this would be impossible.  We do not
know if it would be possible to realize it by another company,
because, from the explanations of the construction company, it will
take the water from the fire prevention system, and it will have a
counter for the water we consume.  Also, according to the contract,
there should be a hedge on the perimeter of the garden.

#### Missing gate

The contract prescribe a gate that is not present.

#### No instruction for the heating system

There are no instructions for the central heating system in the basemant.
It happened that the door was closed, preventing the access.

#### No plants in the garden

An hedge and other plants should be planted.

#### Anti-fire pipe limiting access to the terrace

A pipe has been installed near the planned location of the garden
door, outside our property.  It is not described or illustrated
anywhere, and it looks really ugly.  Also, when the hedge will be
planted it will limit the accessibility to our terrace.  The floor
plan with the garden door imply that this should be a viable entrance
to the terrace.

![pipe](/assets/imgs/pipe.jpg)

The pipe has been installed after the abnahme.

#### Building main door

There is no way to open the door from inside the apartment.

#### Brick in the terrace not well fixed

![terrace-bricks-02](/assets/imgs/terrace-bricks-02.jpg)

##  Keller

#### Holes in the wall

Holes in the wall with water-repellent funny things inside.

![cellar-infiltrations.jpg](/assets/imgs/cellars-infiltrations.jpg)

#### Big pipe on the wall

Installed after the abnahme.
